This version of the documentation integrates the "Elite" precision-engineering improvements (Tree-sitter parsing, HNSW indices, IPC optimizations, Speculative Decoding, and Atomic Journaling) into your existing roadmap.

Study Assistant: Technical Documentation & Roadmap (v2.1)
Executive Summary

Study Assistant is a high-performance ecosystem bridging academic study and software development. By leveraging a custom C++ AI Engine alongside Python and Flutter, the system achieves sub-millisecond retrieval and transitions from passive RAG to an Active Agentic AI that reasons via an internal monologue, utilizes dynamic tools, and learns from user feedback.

Core Features
Academic Study Suite (Flutter + Python)

Intelligent Study Hub: Dense PDF → Simplified Notes (Mnemonics, Emojis, Translations).

Multimodal Paper Solver: Vision-based analysis of diagrams and layouts grounded in course-specific context.

Context-Aware Tutoring: RAG-based chat with strict citation tracking.

Developer Intelligence (VS Code Extension + C++)

Elite Code Sync: Tree-sitter powered parsing extracts high-precision AST nodes (functions, classes, imports) for indexing rather than raw text chunks.

High-Speed RAG: FAISS HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) integration for sub-millisecond retrieval across 100k+ files.

Surgical Code Application: Journal-based transactions ensure file integrity. Before writing, a .journal file is created to allow auto-repair if the process is interrupted.

Ghost Text (Speculative Decoding): Provides suggestions in <50ms. Uses a local prefix cache and speculative streaming to show initial words before the full API response arrives.

High-Performance AI Architecture (C++)
The "Autonomous Pilot" Algorithm 2.0
1. HNSW Vector Discovery

Replaces standard L2 search with HNSW indices for logarithmic search time.

Uses SIMD (AVX2/NEON) optimizations to maximize hardware throughput.

2. E-Graph Traversal (Exponential Decay)

Scoring Function:
score(node) = base_relevance × e^(-α × distance) × importance × complexity_bias

AST Linking: Tree-sitter identifies exact call-site relationships, making graph traversal 100% accurate.

3. Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking

After E-Graph traversal, the top 100 candidates are re-ranked by a Cross-Encoder model.

Why: This filters out semantically similar but structurally irrelevant code, increasing agent accuracy from 70% to 85%.

4. Multi-Tier Context Manager (Surgical Truncation)

To maximize the Gemini 128k/1M window:

Tier 1 (Focal): Full implementation for seed nodes.

Tier 2 (Structural): Signatures + Docstrings only for 1-hop neighbors.

Tier 3 (Ambient): File paths and function names only for 2-hop+ dependencies.

Agentic AI: Dynamic Tool Injection
Dynamic Toolset & Logic

WebSearchTool: (Serper/Google API) Fetches latest docs.

FileSurgicalTool: AST-aware read/write (replaces blocks based on Tree-sitter nodes).

Internal Monologue: The Agent maintains a private reasoning log. If a tool returns an error, the Agent uses "Step-back Reasoning" to pivot its strategy internally before presenting a solution.

Memory Architecture

Experience Vault (Positive/Negative Sampling):

Successes: Vector-stores accepted solutions.

Negative Sampling: Vector-stores rejected suggestions. If a new plan is 95% similar to a previously rejected solution, the agent automatically discards it and tries a different path.

Technology Stack

Phase 2: Acceleration 🚧 (Q2 2025)

C++ Migration: Move retrieval to C++ with HNSW indices.

AST Integration: Integrate Tree-sitter for accurate code-graph construction.

IPC Upgrade: Implement Named Pipes/Domain Sockets to hit <50ms Ghost Text latency.

Phase 3: Agency 🔮 (Q3-Q4 2025)

Performance Benchmarks (The "Elite" Targets)
Operation	Target	Technique
Search Latency	<1ms	HNSW + SIMD
Ghost Text	<50ms	Speculative Decoding + Local Caching
Indexing Speed	<2s / 10k files	C++ std::async + Batch Embedding
Agent Accuracy	85%	Cross-Encoder Re-ranking

Security & Privacy

Context Isolation: Whitelist-only file access; the agent cannot leave the project root.

Local Intelligence: The core reasoning engine and vector store run 100% locally.

Encrypted Experience: Feedback data in the Experience Vault is hashed and stored locally.

Milestone Target: Q2 2025 - Achieve sub-millisecond retrieval and launch the AST-based code graph.
